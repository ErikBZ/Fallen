# Fallen
Fallen was a small, mess of a game I created for one of my english classes at college. This was a sf class and the point of the project
was to create something related to sf. Since I thought writing a short story was going to be too much work, I decided instead to
make a game...
In this game you command up to 5 mech units and to fight off a bunch of cookie cutter enemies. Unfortunately the deadline approached too
fast and the game is still pretty unfinished and stops working after the 3rd turn, but oh well. Maybe one day I'll decide to fix it.
